				<p>Designers used to stand for beauty and order. Now beauty is passé and ugliness is smart. How did we get here and is there any way out?</p>

				<h2>Beauty</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Ask a toad what is beauty… He will answer that it is a female with two great round eyes coming out of her little head, a large flat mouth, a yellow belly and a brown back.</p>
					<p>Ask <a>Paul Rand</a> what is beauty and he will answer that the separation of form and function, of concept and execution, is not likely to produce objects of aesthetic value.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Then ask the same question of the Cranbrook Academy of Art students who created the ad hoc desktop publication <em class="italic">Output</em> (1992), and to judge by the evidence they might answer that beauty is chaos born of found letters layered on top of random patterns and shapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those who value functional simplicity would argue that the Cranbrook students’ publication, like a toad’s warts, is ugly. The difference is that unlike the toad, the Cranbrook students have deliberately given themselves the warts.
				</p>

				<h2>Output</h2>
				<p>
					<em class="italic">Output</em> is eight unbound pages of blips, type fragments, random words and other graphic minutiae purposefully given the serendipitous look of a printer’s make-ready.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lack of any explanatory précis (and only this end note: ‘Upcoming Issues From: School of the Art Institute of Chicago [and] University of Texas’) leaves the reader confused as to its purpose or meaning, though its form leads one to presume that it is intended as a design manifesto, another ‘experiment’ in the current plethora of aesthetically questionable graphic output. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the increase in graduate school programmes which provide both a laboratory setting and freedom from professional responsibility, the word experiment has come to justify a multitude of sins.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-single">The value of design experiments should not of course be measured only by what succeeds, since failures are often steps towards new discoveries.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h2>Value</h2>
				<p>
					Experimentation is the engine of progress, its fuel a mixture of instinct, intelligence and discipline. But the engine floods when too much instinct and not enough intelligence or discipline is injected into the mix.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the case with certain of the graphic design experiments that have emanated from graduate schools in the US and Europe in recent years – work driven by instinct and obscured by theory, with ugliness its foremost by-product.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Rebellion</h2>
				<p>
					From punk to postmodernism, designers have used visual dissonance as rebellion. The punk graphics of the 1970s — raw, aggressive, and naïve — challenged Modernist restraint and evolved into “Swiss Punk,” an anti-canonical offshoot that dismantled the rigid grids of Swiss International Style.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ugly design, in this sense, can be a conscious strategy — warpaint against uniformity. Designers like Art Chantry showed that rough, “unsophisticated” forms could still serve a purpose, proving that ugliness and functionality are not mutually exclusive.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Truth</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-single">
						John Keats wrote, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” but in contemporary design, no single standard of beauty — or ugliness — holds authority. 
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The convention-breaking work from schools like Cranbrook and CalArts may appear chaotic, yet it could also lay the groundwork for new aesthetic systems based on today’s sensibilities.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote-single">
						As Paul Rand warned, “Rarely has beauty been an end in itself” — and neither should ugliness be.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					When used intelligently, dissonance can renew design; when used thoughtlessly, it becomes noise. Ugliness as a tool, a weapon, even as a code is not a problem when it is a result of form following function. But ugliness as its own virtue – or as a knee-jerk reaction to the status quo – diminishes all design.
