                <p>Designers used to stand for beauty and order. Now beauty is passé and ugliness is smart. How did we get here and is there any way out?</p>

                <h2>Beauty</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Ask a toad what is beauty… He will answer that it is a female with two great round eyes coming out of her little head, a large flat mouth, a yellow belly and a brown back.</p>
                    <p class="author">Voltaire: Philosophical Dictionary, 1794.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Ask <a>Paul Rand</a> what is beauty and he will answer that the separation of form and function, of concept and execution, is not likely to produce objects of aesthetic value.</p>
                    <p class="author">Paul Rand: A Designer’s Art, 1985.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Then ask the same question of the Cranbrook Academy of Art students who created the ad hoc desktop publication <em class="italic">Output</em> (1992), and to judge by the evidence they might answer that beauty is chaos born of found letters layered on top of random patterns and shapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those who value functional simplicity would argue that the Cranbrook students’ publication, like a toad’s warts, is ugly. The difference is that unlike the toad, the Cranbrook students have deliberately given themselves the warts.

                <h2>Output</h2>
                <p>
                    <em class="italic">Output</em> is eight unbound pages of blips, type fragments, random words and other graphic minutiae purposefully given the serendipitous look of a printer’s make-ready.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lack of any explanatory précis (and only this end note: ‘Upcoming Issues From: School of the Art Institute of Chicago [and] University of Texas’) leaves the reader confused as to its purpose or meaning, though its form leads one to presume that it is intended as a design manifesto, another ‘experiment’ in the current plethora of aesthetically questionable graphic output. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the increase in graduate school programmes which provide both a laboratory setting and freedom from professional responsibility, the word experiment has come to justify a multitude of sins.

                <h2>Value</h2>
                <p>
                    The value of design experiments should not of course be measured only by what succeeds, since failures are often steps towards new discoveries. Experimentation is the engine of progress, its fuel a mixture of instinct, intelligence and discipline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the engine floods when too much instinct and not enough intelligence or discipline is injected into the mix. This is the case with certain of the graphic design experiments that have emanated from graduate schools in the US and Europe in recent years – work driven by instinct and obscured by theory, with ugliness its foremost by-product.
