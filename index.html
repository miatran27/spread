                <p>Designers used to stand for beauty and order. Now beauty is passé and ugliness is smart. How did we get here and is there any way out?</p>

                <h2>Beauty</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Ask a toad what is beauty… He will answer that it is a female with two great round eyes coming out of her little head, a large flat mouth, a yellow belly and a brown back.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Ask <a>Paul Rand</a> what is beauty and he will answer that the separation of form and function, of concept and execution, is not likely to produce objects of aesthetic value.</p>
                    <p class="author">Paul Rand: A Designer’s Art, 1985.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Then ask the same question of the Cranbrook Academy of Art students who created the ad hoc desktop publication <em class="italic">Output</em> (1992), and to judge by the evidence they might answer that beauty is chaos born of found letters layered on top of random patterns and shapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those who value functional simplicity would argue that the Cranbrook students’ publication, like a toad’s warts, is ugly. The difference is that unlike the toad, the Cranbrook students have deliberately given themselves the warts.

                <h2>Output</h2>
                <p>
                    <em class="italic">Output</em> is eight unbound pages of blips, type fragments, random words and other graphic minutiae purposefully given the serendipitous look of a printer’s make-ready.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lack of any explanatory précis (and only this end note: ‘Upcoming Issues From: School of the Art Institute of Chicago [and] University of Texas’) leaves the reader confused as to its purpose or meaning, though its form leads one to presume that it is intended as a design manifesto, another ‘experiment’ in the current plethora of aesthetically questionable graphic output. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the increase in graduate school programmes which provide both a laboratory setting and freedom from professional responsibility, the word experiment has come to justify a multitude of sins.
